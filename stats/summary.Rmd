# Matching progress

The graph below shows the progress made in matching Food Hygiene Rating Scheme establishments to OpenStreetMap objects using the `fhrs:id` and `addr:postcode` or `not:addr:postcode` tags. Matching objects are considered to have the same postcodes when the FHRS postcode matches either the OpenStreetMap object's `addr:postcode` or its `not:addr:postcode`.

```{r}
fhrs_statistic_defs <- get_fhrs_statistic_defs()

fhrs_summary_by_date %>%
  left_join(fhrs_statistic_defs, by = "statistic") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, value, fill = label)) +

    date_minor_breaks = "1 month",
    labels = year
  ) +

    values = fhrs_statistic_defs %>% select(label, colour) %>% deframe()
  ) +

  labs(
    title = "Matching FHRS establishments with OpenStreetMap objects",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of FHRS establishments",
    fill = NULL,
    caption = paste(
      "Establishments in Northern Ireland and unmatched establishments with no",

```

**`r latest_fhrs_matched_percentage`%** of FHRS establishments (`r label_comma()(latest_matched_establishments)` out of `r label_comma()(latest_total_establishments)`) have been successfully matched to OpenStreetMap objects as of `r strftime(latest_date, '%A %e %B %Y')`.

```{r}
matched_prop_by_district <- latest_fhrs_stats_by_district %>%
  # ignore unmatched FHRS establishments without a location
  filter(statistic != "unmatched_without_location") %>%
  group_by(district_code) %>%
  mutate(total_establishments = sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(statistic == "matched_same_postcodes") %>%
  mutate(prop_matched_same_postcodes = value / total_establishments)

  ggplot(aes(prop_matched_same_postcodes)) +

  geom_boxplot(aes(y = -1), coef = 999, outlier.shape = NA) +

    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```

The median percentage of FHRS establishments matched in a district is `r median(matched_prop_by_district$prop_matched_same_postcodes) %>% percent_format()()`. A quarter of districts have `r quantile(matched_prop_by_district$prop_matched_same_postcodes, 0.25) %>% percent_format()()` or less of their FHRS establishments matched but `r matched_prop_by_district %>% filter(prop_matched_same_postcodes >= 0.9) %>% nrow()` out of `r nrow(matched_prop_by_district)` districts have at least 90% of their FHRS establishments matched. (These statistics ignore unmatched FHRS establishments without a location and only consider matches where the FHRS establishment's postcode is the same as the OpenStreetMap object's `addr:postcode` or `not:addr:postcode`.)

Postcode errors in the FHRS data can be noted using the `not:addr:postcode` tag on the relevant OpenStreetMap object.
